## [0.4.3] - 2021-12-07

* Release helm chart on GL helmrepository
* Upgrade Mariadb helm chart to 10.1.0
* Upgrade Redis helm chart to 15.6.3
* Upgrade default WordPress version to 5.8.2
* Use PHP 8.1

## [0.4.2] - 2021-11-05

* Moved repository to open.greenhost.net/stackspin/wordpress-helm because the
  OpenAppStack project got renamed to Stackspin

## [0.4.1] - 2021-10-26

* Add SMTP settings
* Update to stable ingress API
* Update charts:
  * Mariadb to 9.6.4

## [0.4.0] - 2021-10-20

* Update redis chart to version 15
  * BREAKING: This needs a re-install of the Redis release (this should be OK
    because redis is only for caching). This also needs you to move the
    following variables: 
    - `redis.password` is now `redis.auth.password`
    - `redis.cluster.enabled` is now `redis.architecture`, which takes values
      "standalone" and "replication" (this chart defaults to standalone).
    - See [the Redis chart upgrade guide](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/redis#upgrading)
      for other changes
* Update default WordPress version to 5.8.1
* Update MariaDB chart version to 9.6.2

## [0.3.1] - 2021-09-30

* Fix database service name for standalone architecture

## [0.3.0] - 2021-09-28

* Cron overhaul:
  - Change the sidecar container to run a cron daemon instead of the backup
    script with manual sleep.
  - Put the backup script in a crontab.
  - Remove the kubernetes CronJob that did the wordpress cron calling,
    replacing it by a regular cronjob.
  - Allow custom crontab entries, provided from a helm value.
* Update mariadb chart to 9.6.0
  NOTE: the mariadb chart does not provide backwards compatibility in this
  case, so manual action is required if you want to upgrade an existing
  wordpress-helm release to this new version: either by migrating database data
  from the old release to the new one, or by using the `existingClaim`
  parameter(s) to reuse the existing persistent volumes. For details, see
  [mariadb chart upgrade notes](
  https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/mariadb/9.6.0#to-8-0-0)

## [0.1.7] - 2021-05-12
