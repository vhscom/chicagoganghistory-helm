## [0.5.1] - 2022-02-07

- Disable auto-updates of the WP core by default. WordPress Core updates should
  be managed by the chart and rolled out when the chart is updated. Set
  `.Values.wordpress.updates.wp_auto_update_core` to true to enable WP Core
  auto-updates.

  Additionally, is possible to disable all auto-updates (including the optional
  plugin and theme auto-updates) by setting
  `.Values.wordpress.updates.automatic_updater_disabled` to `true`.`
- Disable editing WordPress files by default. This can be undone by setting the
  `.Values.wordpress.disallow_file_edit` variable to `false`.

## [0.5.0] - 2022-02-04

- Plugins overhaul
  - You can now specify plugins under `.Values.wordpress.plugins`. You can
    specify a slug of a WordPress.org plugin, or an URL to a zip file containing
    a plugin. Examples are shown in `values-local.yaml.example`
  - You now need to specify mu-plugins as a list. see
    `values-local.yaml.example` for examples. Some improvements have been made
    too, like you don't have to enable mu_cron in order to be able to use
    mu_plugins
- Fine-grained control over debug functionality
  - The boolean for the `WP_DEBUG` config variable has moved from
    `.Values.wordpress.site.debug` to `.Values.wordpress.site.debug.enabled`.
  - Two fields `.Values.wordpress.site.debug.display` and
    `.Values.wordpress.site.debug.log` have been added that can be set to `true`
    or `false` to control `WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY` and `WP_DEBUG_LOG` respectively.

## [0.4.0] - 2021-10-20

* Update redis chart to version 15
  * BREAKING: This needs a re-install of the Redis release (this should be OK
    because redis is only for caching). This also needs you to move the
    following variables: 
    - `redis.password` is now `redis.auth.password`
    - `redis.cluster.enabled` is now `redis.architecture`, which takes values
      "standalone" and "replication" (this chart defaults to standalone).
    - See [the Redis chart upgrade guide](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/redis#upgrading)
      for other changes

  - Change the sidecar container to run a cron daemon instead of the backup

  - Remove the kubernetes CronJob that did the wordpress cron calling,
    replacing it by a regular cronjob.
  - Allow custom crontab entries, provided from a helm value.
* Update mariadb chart to 9.6.0
  NOTE: the mariadb chart does not provide backwards compatibility in this
  case, so manual action is required if you want to upgrade an existing
  wordpress-helm release to this new version: either by migrating database data
  from the old release to the new one, or by using the `existingClaim`
  parameter(s) to reuse the existing persistent volumes. For details, see
  [mariadb chart upgrade notes](
  https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/mariadb/9.6.0#to-8-0-0)
